  What's new? To gain a full understanding of changes to Eggdrop1.8.1, 
  please read doc/Changes1.8.

  For support, feel free to visit us on Freenode #eggdrop.

  If you are upgrading from a pre-1.6 version of Eggdrop:

    1. Before you start the bot for the first time, BACKUP your userfile.

    2. DON'T USE YOUR OLD CONFIG FILE. MAKE A NEW ONE!

Major changes made to Eggdrop 1.8.1 from Eggdrop1.8.0:

    Autobotchk - Added functionality improvements to the tried-and-true
      autobotchk script, allowing characters such as {} and [] to be used in
      filenames. Additionally, it can also now handle long botnetnicks for 
      pidfiles and check for additional sourced config files.

    .who linkedbot output - Truncates listings appropriately.

    eggdrop.conf - Update source code to match defaults given in Eggdrop
      configuration file.

    Minutely hook - The minutely hook was only called for missed minutes mod
      60, now it is still listed in minutes but it can be greater than 60.

    Options summary - At the end of configure, Eggdrop now displays a handy
      summary of basic options used during compile. It will display the OS
      and Tcl version found, along with if TLS, IPv6 and SSL are enabled.

    New OpenSSL version detection - A recent update to the OpenSSL libs
      rendered some of our checks invalid, particularly the hexstr2buf call.
      This is now fixed.

    Implemented version.h - Moved previously hard-coded version strings to
      version.h and update them via misc/setpatch instead of misc/addpatch.
      This also fixes inconsistencies in setting the internal version
      integer.

    Compile cleanup - Fixed some compiler warnings. 

    General bugfixes - Small code tweaks to eliminate some rare error
      conditions.
